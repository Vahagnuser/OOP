This project contains solutions to the following problems:
1. Problem1: Determine if an integer is even or odd using bitwise operations.

2. Problem2: Print a series of swimming ducks based on the input.
    -In folder Problem2 have two solutions. One using a string, the other just if else statements.

3. Problem3: Print a specified triangle pattern.

4. Problem4: Print a sentence in reverse.

5. Problem5: Validate the format of an AUA ID.

6. Problem6: Print the powers of two that make up an integer using bitwise operations.


Testing:
- Each program has been tested with various inputs to ensure correctness.
