This project contains solutions to the following problems:

1. Problem1: Leap Year Checker
   - Implemented isLeapYear(int year) method to check if a year is a leap year.
   - Generated three random years from the 20th century and checked if at least two are leap years.

2. Problem2: Palindrome Checker
   - Problem2.java: Reads a string and an integer from the user and checks if they are palindromes using methods from CsUtils.
   - CsUtils.java: Implemented methods to efficiently check palindrome for strings (isPalindrome(String s)) and integers (isPalindrome(int n)).

3. Problem3: Student Score Processor
   - Reads student names and exam scores, calculates and prints:
     - Name of the student with the highest score.
     - Name of the student with the second highest score.
     - Average score in the class.
     - Difference between the highest and lowest scores.

4. Problem4: Prime Factorization
   - Tests the findPrimeFactors(int n) method from CsUtils.java.
   - Implemented a recursive method to find prime factors of a natural number.

5. Problem5: Snake Order 2D Array
   - Generates an n x n 2D array filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in snake order.
   - CsUtils.java:The method is called for prints the arrays for n = 3 and n = 4.

6. Problem6: Spiral Order 2D Array
   - Generates an n x n 2D array filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in spiral order.
   - CsUtils.java:The method is called for prints the arrays for size = 3 and size = 4.

Testing:
- Each program has been tested with various inputs to ensure correctness.
